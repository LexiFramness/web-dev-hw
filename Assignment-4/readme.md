<h1>Assignment 4</h1>

<h2>Questions</h2>

## Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
Ids are a global identifier and should be unique. Divs allows the developer to group elements together. Class is another identifier used for HTML without a CSS, and can be used grouped elements together. Spans name div elements.
## What is "alt text," and why do we use it?
Describes images to someone who can't see the image, possibly due to a loading error. It also helps show if a link is moved or broken.
## Summarize work cycle.
This week was fairly straight forward, I could not find the song in an mp3 format to embed, so I embedded a preview link from Apple Music, which is the media player I use.
