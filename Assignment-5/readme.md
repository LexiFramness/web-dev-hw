<h2>Technical Report</h2>

## Briefly describe your design research
I choose to use images from the 1980s. I picked colors for the backgrounds that seems to match up with what I found used in images when I did a google search of the 1980s.
## What colors were used.
I decided to use a black background for the body of my html page, and then used pink, light blue, and gold for the colors of my div backgrounds.
## Summarize work cycle.
This week was fairly straight forward, the most difficult part was the opacity, I originally tried to put it in the CSS file, but was struggling so i ended up putting it in style on my index.html file.
