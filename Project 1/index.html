<h2>Live it Well</h2>

<p>
I want to live it well
I want to live it well

Take the burden from my arms
Take the anchors off my lungs
Take me broken
And make me one
Break the silence and make it a song

Life is short I want to live it well
One life, one story to tell
Life is short I want to live it well
And you're the one I'm living for
Awaken, oh my soul!
Every breath that you take is a miracle
Life is short I want to live it well

I want to sing with all my heart a lifelong song
Even if some notes come out right and some come out wrong
'Cause I can't take none of that through the door
I'm living for more than just a funeral
I want to burn brighter than the dawn

Life is short I want to live it well
One life, one story to tell
Life is short I want to live it well
And you're the one I'm living for
Awaken, oh my soul!
Every breathe that you take is a miracle
Life is short I want to live it well

I got one life
And one love
I got one voice
But maybe that's enough
'Cause with one heartbeat
And two hands to give
I got one shot
One life to live
One life to live

Every breath you take is a miracle

Life is short I want to live it well
