  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Alexis Framness, I just transfered from the Journalism school,
      after deciding media arts was more of what I am interested in. Unfortunetly in
      the last year, I learned that I am Celiac, with means my immune system attacks
      my body when I eat anything containing gluten. So I have had to find gluten free
      versions of what I enjoy to eat, and that is much easier said than done. Unfortunetly
      most gluten free food, lacks actual flavor, and gluten free products costs way more.

      I choose this to do this homemade chocolate because since having to start making
      my own gluten free verisons of my favorite foods, I have found a hidden love for
      cooking and baking, and I was taught the recipe for chocolate by a friend who is
      also a celiac.
