<h1>Project 2</h1>

<h2>Description of Project 2</h2>

For the project we were supposed to create a 3+ page website, thats purpose is to teach someone how to make or build something. I decided on creating a website that showed people how to make homemade chocolate in under 1 hour. I also decided to include a page referencing other similar homemade chocolate options. For the website I decided to use the structure that we used from assignment 4, and make minor adjustments as I felt it necessary to do so. I put the navigation bar at the top of the page, and gave it some minor styling elements. The most time consuming part of this project was taking photos of each step of the process, so that I could have photo documentation for the website.
